# Smart PHP Log Analyzer


The **Smart PHP Log Analyzer** is a real-time logging and visualization tool designed to monitor and analyze log data efficiently. It helps developers track error trends, key metrics, and system performance using dynamically updated logs and graphical visualizations.

This project utilizes PHP for log generation and parsing, JavaScript with Chart.js for real-time data visualization, and Bootstrap for an intuitive user interface. It provides insights into system behavior by categorizing log entries and displaying error trends through bar charts and other visual elements.
